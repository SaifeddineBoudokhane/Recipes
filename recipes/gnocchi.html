            <h4>Cook the bacon:</h4>
            <p>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Keep 1-2 tablespoons of the drippings in the pan.</p>

            <h4>Brown the gnocchi:</h4>
            <p>Increase the heat to medium-high. Add half of the gnocchi and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with remaining gnocchi.</p>

            <h4>Make the sauce:</h4>
            <p>Without wiping the skillet clean, add the water, cheese, mustard, and salt; stir to melt cheese and make a smooth sauce, about 2 minutes. Stir in the peas. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the peas are warmed through, about 1 minute.</p>

            <h4>Finish and serve:</h4>
            <p>Add the browned gnocchi and half (about 1/4 cup) of the bacon back to the skillet. Stir to coat with the sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has slightly thickened, about 1 minute.</p>
            <p>Remove from heat and serve sprinkled with remaining 1/4 cup bacon and chives, if using. Serve immediately. Because of the stodgy nature of gnocchi, this recipe does not save well. Enjoy it while it lasts!</p>
